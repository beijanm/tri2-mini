<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Our Progress</strong></h1>

# Ever since starting our exciting dive into the world of binary code, we picked up many things in the way! 
<br>
- We started by grasping the essence of binaryâ€”how computers understand information through 0s and 1s. It was mind-boggling to see how these sequences of digits convey everything in the digital realm. We were able to count on our fingers and see it translate to on screen.
<br>
But we didn't stop at theory; we wanted to get hands-on. So, we decided to build a clock using binary! It was a challenge, breaking down hours, minutes, and seconds into these 0s and 1s. We had to think differently, translating time into a whole new language.
<br>
We dug into the code, understanding how these binary patterns translated back into the time we're familiar with. Seeing the synchronization between the binary sequences and the actual time was an "aha!" moment for us. Every bit mattered, quite literally!
<br>
In the end, we not only understood binary at a deeper level but also showcased our learning by creating a clock that ticked in binary within VSCode. It was amazing to witness how a language so different from our own could communicate something as universal as time.
<br>
In our exploration, we didn't stop at just a binary clock; we pushed further and crafted a binary color wheel in VSCode, where each color was represented by its RGB values in binary. It was a thrilling culmination of our understanding, visualizing colors through this intricate binary language, making the digital canvas vibrant and alive.
