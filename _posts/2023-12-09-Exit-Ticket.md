## Binary Frontend Forever
    - When you click the button "Click Me" it displays a list of binary numbers. Made by 

## Binary Math Hack
    - A simple calculator but instead of just a number output, it also puts outputs in binary and Bitwise. Made by

## Binary Colorwheel
    - Has a description of how 8-bit binary numbers represent colors and goes more in detail between the relation between colors and binary, and has a little color wheel which shows the color on the wheel and what the color is and the color as a binary value. Made by Howie and 

## Left/Right Shift Binary Code Wheel 
    - Has 2 inputs, one for a binary number, the other for how many shifts you want. For example, when I input the number 010001 and put in 2 left shits, the output is: 
    # "Initial binary number: 010001 Left-shift 1 times: 100010 Left-shift 2 times: 1000100" When I put in 2 right shifts, the output is 
    "Initial binary number: 010001 Right-shift 1 times: 1000 Right-shift 2 times: 100." Made by Jake and Timo

## Binary Conversion and Operations
    - Asks for an input of a binary number and when you click the buttom "Perform Actions" the output displays Decimal: 18 Binary: 010010 Bitwise AND (with 1010): 10 Bitwise OR (with 1010): 11010 Bitwise XOR (with 1010): 11000 Bitwise NOT: 101101 Left Shift (2 bits): 1001000 Right Shift (2 bits): 100.

## Binary Numeral Hex Converter
    - For this you put in a regular number and it displays the same number but in binary. Made by: 

## Binary Search Algorithm
    - A work in progress, turns binary code/values into letters and you can search things up using those values. Right now the inputs dont work put the output does so we will continue to fix it. Made by: 

## Binary Word Game
    - Has a key showing all the letters represented by binary numbers and it gives you a couple binary values that you have to decode and try to guess the word encoded in the binary. If correct it gives you the message "Correct!", if wrong gives you the message "Incorrect, Try Again" Made by: 

## Binary to Decimal Guessing Game
    - Same as the Binary Word Game, its a guessing format so it gives you a decimal value and you have to try guess the decimal value of the binary number. If incorrect, it displays, "Incorrect. The correct answer was 'number''". If correct displays "Correct! Well done." Made by:

## Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) Clock
    - Shows all the coding functions at the bottom and displays the current time in both binary and decimal formats. Each column represents a digit of the current time in binary format, from top (most significant bit) to bottom (least significant bit). The first two columns represent the hour, the next two represent the minute, and the last two represent the second. The time is displayed in 12-hour format with an AM/PM indicator. Made by: 

## Digital Clock (In Binary)
    - displays current date, 202x-xx-xx, binary time xx : xxx : xxxx AM/PM Decimal Time xx : xx : xx AM/PM. There are multiple different colors the clock can change and the clock color changes based on the combined binary representation of time (hours, minutes, seconds). For instance, the individual binary digits affect the color. Made by:
